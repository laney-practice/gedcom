#
#  A code used to indicate the child to family relationship for pedigree navigation purposes.
#  Where:
#    adopted:: indicates adoptive parents.
#    birth::   indicates birth parents.
#    foster::  indicates child was included in a foster or guardian family.
#    sealing:: indicates child was sealed to parents other than birth parents.
#
#  The normal lineage links are shown through the use of pointers from the individual to a family
#  through either the FAMC tag or the FAMS tag. The FAMC tag provides a pointer to a family where
#  this person is a child. The FAMS tag provides a pointer to a family where this person is a spouse or
#  parent. The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> (see page 27) structure contains a FAMC pointer
#  which is required to show any child to parent linkage for pedigree navigation. The
#  <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure also indicates whether the pedigree link represents a
#  birth lineage, an adoption lineage, or a sealing lineage.
#
#  Linkage between a child and the family they belonged to at the time of an event can also optionally
#  be shown by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the appropriate event. For example, a FAMC pointer
#  subordinate to an adoption event would show which family adopted this individual. Biological parent
#  or parents can be indicated by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event. The FAMC tag can
#  also optionally be used subordinate to an ADOPtion, or BIRTh event to differentiate which set of
#  parents were related by adoption, sealing, or birth.
#
#The attributes are all arrays for the level +1 tags/records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in this record.
