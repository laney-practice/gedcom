#  Note:: The usage of IDNO requires that the subordinate TYPE tag be used to define what kind of
#         number is assigned to IDNO.
#
#  Also Note that SEX has been added here, and removed from the Individual_record. This allows SEX
#  To be included multiple times, and have associated events (e.g. a sex change). I also do not check
#  That the SEX_VALUE is M,F or U. to allow for the XXY, XXXY and X and other genetic anomolies 
#  associated with gender that might need to be recorded. None of this affects reading GEDCOM files,
#  and will not affect the writing of them if you don't add an event, or use non-standard SEX_VALUEs.
#
#The attributes are all arrays for the level +1 tags/records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in this record.
