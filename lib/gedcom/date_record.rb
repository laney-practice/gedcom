#  Examples:
#  FROM 1904 to 1915
#    The state of some attribute existed from 1904 to 1915 inclusive.
#  FROM 1904
#    The state of the attribute began in 1904 but the end date is unknown.

#  Any statement offered as a date when the year is not recognizable to a date parser, but which gives
#  information about when an event occurred. The date phrase is enclosed in matching parentheses.

#  
#  Where:
#  AFT:: Event happened after the given date.
#  BEF:: Event happened before the given date.
#  BET:: Event happened some time between date 1 AND date 2. For example, bet 1904 and 1915
#        indicates that the event state (perhaps a single day) existed somewhere between 1904 and
#        1915 inclusive.
#
#  The date range differs from the date period in that the date range is an estimate that an event happened
#  on a single date somewhere in the date range specified.
#
#  The following are equivalent and interchangeable:

#  ----------       -----------

#  1852             BET 1 JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852
#  1852             BET JAN 1852 AND 31 DEC 1852
#  1852             BET JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852

#  <DATE> | <DATE_PERIOD> | <DATE_RANGE> | <DATE_APPROXIMATED> | INT <DATE> (<DATE_PHRASE>) | (<DATE_PHRASE>)
# 
#  The DATE_VALUE represents the date of an activity, attribute, or event where:
#  INT:: Interpreted from knowledge about the associated date phrase included in parentheses.
#
#  An acceptable alternative to the date phrase choice is to use one of the other choices such as
#  <DATE_APPROXIMATED> choice as the DATE line value and then include the
#  <DATE_PHRASE> as a NOTE value subordinate to the DATE line.
#
#  The date value can take on the date form of just a date, an approximated date, between a date and
#  another date, and from one date to another date. The preferred form of showing date imprecision, is
#  to show, for example, MAY 1890 rather than ABT 12 MAY 1890. This is because limits have not
#  been assigned to the precision of the prefixes such as ABT or EST.
#
#==DAY:=                                                 {Size=1:2}
#  dd
#
#  Day of the month, where dd is a numeric digit whose value is within the valid range of the days for the
#  associated calendar month.
#
#=TIME_VALUE:= {Size=1:12}
#  [ hh:mm:ss.fs ]
#
#  The time of a specific event, usually a computer-timed event, where:
#    hh:: hours on a 24-hour clock
#    mm:: minutes
#    ss:: seconds (optional)
#    fs:: decimal fraction of a second (optional)
#
#The attributes are all arrays for the level +1 tags/records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in this record.
